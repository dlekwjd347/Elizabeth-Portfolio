# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap: Responsive Portfolio

#Responsive design ensures that web applications render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. As a developer, you will likely be asked to create a mobile-first application or add responsive design to an existing application. 


## Changes to Elizabeth's Portfolio
#First, I created an Index.html, Portfolio.html, and Contact.html files and connected them to each other using the nav-link element.
#Using Bootstrap, I enhanced my portfolio by adding elements such as carousels, media bodies, cards, navbar, and forms. 
#To accomodate for different screen sizes, I added a reponsive property to each page to adjust each column for changes along with responsive images.
